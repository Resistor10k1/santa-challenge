# Santa-Challenge code documentation

## Introduction

Just a short documentation of the code used to solve the santa-challenge.


## Goal of the challenge

Help Santa distribute the gifts all over the world. Therefore, the overall weighted-reindeer-weariness (\\(WRW\\)) must be minimized. All sleigh trips start at the North-Pole (Lat=90, Long=0), then head to each gift in a specified order, and finally head back to the North-Pole. Santa's sleigh has a base weight of 10 and a weight limit of 1000 (excluding the sleigh base weight).

The weighted-reindeer-weariness is calculated with the following folmula:

$$WRW = \sum_{j=1}^m \sum_{i=1}^{n_j} \sum_{k=i}^{n_j} w_{kj} * Dist(Loc_i, Loc_{i-1})$$

Where \\(m\\) is the number of trips, \\(n_j =\\)(#gifts for trip \\(j\\))\\(+1\\), \\(w_{ij}\\) is the weight of the \\(i\\)-th gift at trip \\(j\\), \\(Loc_i\\) is the location of gift \\(i\\). \\(Loc_0\\) and \\(Loc_{n_j}\\) are the North-Pole, and \\(w_{n_{j},j}\\) (the last leg of each trip) is always the base weight of the sleigh.

The \\(Dist(Loc_i, Loc_{i-1})\\) function returns the Haversine distance \\(d\\) between location \\(i\\) and \\(i-1\\).

\\(\varphi_1, \varphi_2\\) : Latitude of \\(Loc_1\\) resp. \\(Loc_2\\) in radians<br>
\\(\lambda_1, \lambda_2\\) : Longitude of \\(Loc_1\\) resp. \\(Loc_2\\) in radians<br>
\\(r\\) : Radius of the earth (6371.0087714km)

$$ d = 2r \arcsin \left( \sqrt {\sin^2 ({\frac{\varphi_2-\varphi_1}{2}}) + \cos(\varphi_1)\cos(\varphi_2) \sin^2 ({\frac{\lambda_2-\lambda_1}{2}})} \right) $$

#### Example

Two gifts \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are delivered in a trip. Then the \\(WRW\\) is calculated as follows:

\\(
\begin{aligned}
&Dist(NorthPole \rightarrow A) &&* (base\\_weight + weight(B) + weight(A))&& \\\\
&Dist(A \rightarrow B) &&* (base\\_weight + weight(B))&& \\\\
&Dist(B \rightarrow NorthPole) &&* (base\\_weight)&&
\end{aligned}
\\)
